# 2022 Tri 3 Week 6: 4/25 - 5/2, AP Preparation Week 2.
This is the seccond of two weeks of AP Test Study. Everyone will be performing AP Classroom MCQs and FRQs, even PBL coders unless they get an exception.
### Practice Testing
Everyone is doing test this week.  Only exception is if I have observed actions in your PBL and provided an exception.
    * MCQ testing.  MCQ scores will be posted on GitHub Pages.  AP Testers will provide corrections, PBL Testers only need scores.
    * FRQ testing.  FRQs will be performed on paper by AP Testers, on an IDE by PBL Coders.  AP Testers will post pictures of Quiz on GitHub Pages, everyone will have a REPL link with all FRQs completed prior to Monday grading.


### Grading Adjustments
Review ticket should be provided by grader with check boxes and clear tangibles showing completion. I have not been seeing this, yet the crossover grader is giving extremely high marks.  For remainder of year, particularly as we move back to PBL project, students need to provide clarity of tangibles in their review ticket.
    * Crossover.  Grading has been very casual lately. If tangible work is not shown in review ticket, work should be considered incomplete and .5/1 should be maximum score.  In crossover session, you have options to suggest and update information during grading.  However, if grader provides 1/1 on work without tangibles they will max out at 4.5/5 on their own work.  Collaboration and Peer review is a key part of Computer Science.
    * Attendance.  Absence, Sick, or Events.  These last couple of weeks many have been missing class.  I have asked, in past, that you message me in Slack and discuss what you can do to make things up.  In PBL, as well as Test Prep, attendance is very important.  Also, if you don't participate in the events of class, like peer review grading, you are missing important learning experiences.
    * Teacher review.  From now on Teacher will reserve .5 after crossover evaluations.  Maximum crossover score will be 4.5/5.  Teacher will be looking at Tangbiles, Student completenes, and Grader evaluations for final .5.


### Here is Friday Improv Activity - Extra credit and donuts will be up for grabs.
Northeastern University requires all of its computer science majors to take improv class ... The Wall Street Journal says it "forces students to come out of their shells and exercise creative play" before they can get their diplomas. ... "We saw a lot of hysterics and crying," says Carla E. Brodley, dean of the computer science department.).  Rules...
    1. Pick a subject that is related to Tech, Teaching, Study, Classroom or N@tM.
    2. Must be done in one or two Scrum Teams, not participating is a 1 point deduction from Seed
    3. Objective is to make Teacher(s) laugh, cry, or be amazed. Probably best if it has an educational basis.
    4. Top improv or improv ideas may earn spots in N@tM finals, with additional REWARDS.
    5. Time 2 to 5 minutes
